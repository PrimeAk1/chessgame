# Chess Game in JavaFX

## Overview
This is a fully functional chess game built using JavaFX. The project implements all the core features required to play a standard game of chess. The user interface is intuitive and interactive, allowing players to move pieces according to the rules of chess.

## Features
- Fully implemented chessboard with an 8x8 grid.
- Movement rules for all chess pieces, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings.
- Enforcement of legal moves (e.g., pawns capturing diagonally, knights moving in an L-shape, etc.).
- Turn-based play between two players.
- Detection of invalid moves.

## Missing Features
While the game is mostly complete, the following advanced features have not yet been implemented:
- **Check Detection**: The game does not currently detect when a king is in check.
- **Checkmate Detection**: The game does not currently recognize when a player has won by delivering checkmate.
- **Castling**: The special king and rook move known as castling is not yet implemented.

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **JavaFX SDK**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the JavaFX SDK set up on your system.
3. Compile and run the project using your preferred IDE or build tool (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Maven).

## How to Play
1. Launch the game.
2. You must enter your nickname before starting the game.
3. The chessboard will appear, and the game begins with White's turn.
4. Play chess with a friend.


## Future Enhancements
- Implement check detection to alert players when their king is under threat.
- Add logic for checkmate to end the game when a player has no legal moves and their king is in check.
- Implement castling for both kingside and queenside.
